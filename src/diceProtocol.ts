/*

  Use this protocol to make roll shortcuts in other extensions.

  # Setup

  The dice extension will send its config on channel "general.diceClient.hello" when it starts. The config will have the format of the DiceRollerConfig type.The dice client can request the config be sent again by sending an empty message on channel "general.diceRoller.hello"

  # Roll request

  The client can request a dice roll by sending a roll request using the RollRequest type formatting to the channel specified in the dice roller config. If a roll is currently in progress the request will be rejected and an error logged in the console.

  # Roll result 

  The result is sent to the channel that the roll request specified. It might also get sent to a general dice result channel in the future so a general roll log extensions can be made. The result will have the format of the Roll Result type.
